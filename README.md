# üìò Chapter 1 ‚Äì Why Awareness Training Matters (and how to do it without budget)

## 1. Why is Security Awareness Training Important?

Most cyberattacks today don‚Äôt start with fancy hacking tools. They start with **people making mistakes**.

* Clicking a fake email (phishing).
* Using weak passwords.
* Plugging an unknown USB into the laptop.
* Sharing information with a fake caller.

üëâ 91% of cyber incidents happen because of **human error**.
Even if a company spends lakhs on firewalls, antivirus, and monitoring tools ‚Äî **all of it fails if an employee clicks the wrong link**.

That‚Äôs why awareness training is important: it **turns employees into the first line of defense**.

---

## 2. Common Problems Without Awareness Training

* Employees don‚Äôt know how phishing emails look.
* They reuse weak passwords everywhere.
* They install unknown apps or connect to unsafe WiFi.
* They think ‚Äúsecurity is IT‚Äôs problem, not mine.‚Äù

üëâ Result: One careless mistake ‚Üí entire company data stolen.

---

## 3. Why Clients Will Pay Attention (Your Value)

When you give Security Awareness Training, you help the company:

* **Reduce Risk** ‚Üí Fewer phishing clicks, fewer breaches.
* **Save Money** ‚Üí Avoid cyberattack costs.
* **Compliance** ‚Üí ISO 27001, GDPR, HIPAA, PCI all require awareness training.
* **Culture Change** ‚Üí Employees become security conscious.

Even small and medium businesses care, because one ransomware attack can **shut them down**.

---

## 4. How to Do This Without Big Budget

Big companies buy expensive training platforms (like KnowBe4, Cofense). But you can **replicate the same idea with free tools**.

Here‚Äôs how:

* **Videos** ‚Üí Record with OBS Studio, host on YouTube (private).
* **Infographics/Posters** ‚Üí Create with Canva (free).
* **Quizzes** ‚Üí Google Forms / Kahoot.
* **Phishing Test** ‚Üí GoPhish (open source).
* **Tracking** ‚Üí Google Sheets / Moodle reports.

üëâ With these free tools, you can deliver a **professional service** that looks polished, and clients won‚Äôt feel the difference.

---

## 5. What Clients Care About (How You Satisfy Them)

Clients don‚Äôt care if you use paid tools or free tools.
They only care about:

* **Visible Results** (e.g., phishing click rate went from 40% to 10%).
* **Engagement** (employees enjoy the training, not bored).
* **Proof** (reports, certificates, dashboards).

If you can show these 3 things ‚Üí client will be satisfied.

---

‚úÖ **Summary (Chapter 1 in One Line):**
Cybersecurity is not only about firewalls and antivirus. **People are the first line of defense**. Security Awareness Training makes employees smarter against attacks. And with free tools, you can deliver this training effectively without spending big money.

---

2. Add 10‚Äì15 questions, mix of multiple-choice + short answer.
3. Example Questions:

   * Do you reuse the same password for work and personal accounts?
   * If you get a suspicious email, what will you do first?
   * Do you know what MFA (multi-factor authentication) means?
   * True/False: Clicking links from unknown senders is safe if it looks urgent.
4. Collect responses anonymously OR with employee emails (depends on client preference).
5. Export results to Google Sheets ‚Üí analyze % of correct answers.

**Output:** A simple report ‚Üí ‚Äú40% of employees failed phishing-related questions.‚Äù

* Employees receive test emails (e.g., fake password reset, fake shipping notification).
* You track who clicks or enters credentials.

**Steps:**

1. Install GoPhish (works on Windows/Linux).
2. Set up sending profile (use client-approved email domain or test SMTP).
3. Create a **phishing template**:

   * Example: ‚ÄúYour Office365 password is expiring. Click here to reset.‚Äù
   * Add client logo for realism.
4. Send to 10‚Äì20 employees as sample (with client‚Äôs permission).
5. Track results:

   * % who clicked the link.
   * % who entered fake credentials.
   * % who reported the email.

**Output:** ‚Äú25% of employees clicked the link, 10% entered credentials.‚Äù

---

## 4. **Step 3 ‚Äì Compile Results into Report**

Put survey + phishing test together into a **baseline report**.

**Format (Google Docs / Canva):**

* Title: *Cybersecurity Awareness Baseline Report*
* Section 1: Survey Results ‚Üí ‚Äú65% of employees don‚Äôt use MFA.‚Äù
* Section 2: Phishing Test Results ‚Üí ‚Äú25% clicked fake link.‚Äù
