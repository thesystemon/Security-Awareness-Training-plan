# 📘 Chapter 1 – Why Awareness Training Matters (and how to do it without budget)

## 1. Why is Security Awareness Training Important?

Most cyberattacks today don’t start with fancy hacking tools. They start with **people making mistakes**.

* Clicking a fake email (phishing).
* Using weak passwords.
* Plugging an unknown USB into the laptop.
* Sharing information with a fake caller.

👉 91% of cyber incidents happen because of **human error**.
Even if a company spends lakhs on firewalls, antivirus, and monitoring tools — **all of it fails if an employee clicks the wrong link**.

That’s why awareness training is important: it **turns employees into the first line of defense**.

---

## 2. Common Problems Without Awareness Training

* Employees don’t know how phishing emails look.
* They reuse weak passwords everywhere.
* They install unknown apps or connect to unsafe WiFi.
* They think “security is IT’s problem, not mine.”

👉 Result: One careless mistake → entire company data stolen.

---

## 3. Why Clients Will Pay Attention (Your Value)

When you give Security Awareness Training, you help the company:

* **Reduce Risk** → Fewer phishing clicks, fewer breaches.
* **Save Money** → Avoid cyberattack costs.
* **Compliance** → ISO 27001, GDPR, HIPAA, PCI all require awareness training.
* **Culture Change** → Employees become security conscious.

Even small and medium businesses care, because one ransomware attack can **shut them down**.

---

## 4. How to Do This Without Big Budget

Big companies buy expensive training platforms (like KnowBe4, Cofense). But you can **replicate the same idea with free tools**.

Here’s how:

* **Videos** → Record with OBS Studio, host on YouTube (private).
* **Infographics/Posters** → Create with Canva (free).
* **Quizzes** → Google Forms / Kahoot.
* **Phishing Test** → GoPhish (open source).
* **Tracking** → Google Sheets / Moodle reports.

👉 With these free tools, you can deliver a **professional service** that looks polished, and clients won’t feel the difference.

---

## 5. What Clients Care About (How You Satisfy Them)

Clients don’t care if you use paid tools or free tools.
They only care about:

* **Visible Results** (e.g., phishing click rate went from 40% to 10%).
* **Engagement** (employees enjoy the training, not bored).
* **Proof** (reports, certificates, dashboards).

If you can show these 3 things → client will be satisfied.

---

✅ **Summary (Chapter 1 in One Line):**
Cybersecurity is not only about firewalls and antivirus. **People are the first line of defense**. Security Awareness Training makes employees smarter against attacks. And with free tools, you can deliver this training effectively without spending big money.

   * Example: “Your Office365 password is expiring. Click here to reset.”
   * Add client logo for realism.
4. Send to 10–20 employees as sample (with client’s permission).
5. Track results:

   * % who clicked the link.
   * % who entered fake credentials.
   * % who reported the email.

**Output:** “25% of employees clicked the link, 10% entered credentials.”

---

## 4. **Step 3 – Compile Results into Report**

Put survey + phishing test together into a **baseline report**.

**Format (Google Docs / Canva):**

* Title: *Cybersecurity Awareness Baseline Report*
* Section 1: Survey Results → “65% of employees don’t use MFA.”
* Section 2: Phishing Test Results → “25% clicked fake link.”

# 📘 Chapter 10 – Practical Drills & Exercises

*(Password tests, USB awareness, social-engineering role-play, and hands-on activities you can run with zero budget)*

These hands-on drills turn abstract lessons into real behaviour change. They’re cheap, fast, and memorable — exactly what small budgets need.

---

## 1 — Guiding principles before you run drills

* **Get written permission** from client leadership (scope, targets, timing).
* **Safety first:** never use malware, never exfiltrate real data, never humiliate staff.
* **Learning-focused:** every failed test must end with teaching — not blame.
* **Document everything** (plan, consent, results, follow-up).
* **Short & repeatable:** run small drills often rather than big rare tests.

---

## 2 — Password Strength Test (Quick, safe, effective)

**Goal:** show weak password habits and teach strong alternatives.

**Tools:** Google Forms, HaveIBeenPwned (demonstration only), or offline checks.

**Steps:**

1. Create a **voluntary** Google Form where employees paste a representation of a password pattern (do **not** collect real passwords). Example approaches:

   * Ask users to rate the strength of sample passwords.
   * Ask them to create a **sample** password on paper but mask characters (e.g., show `P@ssw***2025` — last chars hidden).
2. OR run a **class exercise**: show 8 sample passwords and ask teams to rank them from weakest→strongest.
3. Demo password cracking (recorded video): show how fast a weak password is cracked (use a pre-recorded demo on a local VM — *never run* on production).
4. Teach: passphrases, length >12, unique passwords, password managers (recommend free ones).

**Output to client:** percentage of employees who chose weak passwords in exercise, recommendations (password manager rollout, MFA enforcement).

---

## 3 — USB Drop Awareness Drill (Physical, safe)

**Goal:** show risks of unknown removable media.

**Safety note:** never use real malware. Use inert USBs with a label and a learning file.

**Materials:** blank USB sticks, printed label (e.g., “Payroll 2025”), short harmless PDF on the stick that explains the drill.

**Steps:**

1. Agree scope and location with client (offsite areas, reception, floors).
2. Place a few labelled USBs in public spaces during work hours.
3. Monitor (ethical options):

   * Have a volunteer in IT check logs for which machines access file shares (if consented), OR
   * Rely on voluntary self-reporting — tell employees to report found USBs to security as part of drill.
4. If a USB is plugged in (observed): immediately pull the user into a short 1:1 coaching session and show what could have happened.
5. Share lessons: disable autorun, use endpoint controls, never plug unknown drives.

**Client deliverable:** number of USBs found, number reported without plugging, coaching notes, policy recommendations.

---

## 4 — Social Engineering Role-Play (Phone/SMS/Walk-in)

**Goal:** raise awareness of vishing (voice phishing), smishing (SMS), and in-person impersonation.

**Preparation (always with consent):**

* Define allowed scripts and refusal lines.
* Choose a small controlled subset (HR, reception) for initial runs.
* Brief observers (manager + security rep) and have a debrief plan.

**Sample role-play scripts:**

A. *Vishing (voice)* — Caller impersonates IT:

> “Hi, this is IT. We’re testing MFA resets due to a system update. Can you please confirm your employee ID and the last 4 of your phone number so we can complete the test?”

**Expected correct response:** “I’ll check with IT directly / call back on the official number.”
**Coaching point:** never provide credentials or personal info over unsolicited calls.

B. *Smishing (SMS)*:

> SMS: “Urgent: Your payroll account needs verification. Click [https://short.url/payroll”](https://short.url/payroll”)

**Expected correct response:** report to IT, do not click.
**Coaching point:** verify links, report suspicious SMS.

C. *In-person impersonation*:

> Actor with fake badge asks reception to “let me in, head to Mr. X’s desk to deliver documents.”

**Expected correct response:** Ask for ID, check with receptionist/manager.

**Debriefing:** Immediately after role-play, do a calm, educational debrief with the targeted person — show what red flags were present and what to do next.

**Metrics:** percent who followed correct protocol vs those who didn’t, common mistakes.

---

## 5 — Email-Reporting Drill (Train the behavior of “report, don’t click”)

**Goal:** make reporting suspicious emails habitual.

**Method:**

1. Send a harmless test email (non-phishing but crafted to look suspicious) to target group.
2. Track how many users *report* it via the agreed reporting channel (e.g., [phish@company.com](mailto:phish@company.com) or a button in the email client).
3. Reward/report results and provide micro-training to non-reporters.

**Success KPIs:** reporting rate, time-to-report average.

---

## 6 — Safe Browsing Practical Exercise

**Goal:** teach URL inspection, padlock meaning, and lookalike domains.

**Exercise:**

* Show 8 URLs (images/screenshots) and ask teams to find which are malicious/lookalike.
* Use screenshots of classic typosquatting domains (example formats: `micr0soft.com`, `paypai.com`) — never use live malicious domains.

**Debrief:** demonstrate browser tools to inspect links (`hover to see destination`), and rules of thumb (https ≠ safe by itself).

---

## 7 — Mobile Security Mini-Drill

**Goal:** teach safe mobile app installs and Wi-Fi hygiene.

**Activities:**

* Quick quiz: “Which app is safe?” with screenshots of suspicious permissions.
* Demonstrate a fake free Wi-Fi login page and explain captive portal risks.
* Teach: use mobile vendor app stores only, check app permissions, avoid public Wi-Fi for sensitive work unless VPN is used.

---

## 8 — Incident Reporting & Tabletop Exercise

**Goal:** practice the company’s incident reporting & escalation process in a low-stress setting.

**Tabletop exercise steps:**

1. Present a simple scenario: “An employee clicked a phishing link and received a ransom note.”
2. Walk through actions: who reports, who isolates machine, who informs management, who notifies external parties (if needed).
3. Use Google Docs to capture flow; assign roles and expected timelines.

**Output to client:** document with suggested improvements to IR process (contact list, roles, SLAs).

---

## 9 — Measurement, Documentation & Client Reporting

For each drill, capture:

* **Scope & consent** (who approved, what’s allowed).
* **Participants** (list or count).
* **Results** (click/report numbers, behaviours observed).
* **Coaching actions taken** (who got one-on-one coaching).
* **Recommendations** (policy changes, technical controls).

Create a simple **drill report** template (Google Docs) with: overview, objectives, methodology, results, findings, remediation steps, and a 1-page executive summary.

---

## 10 — Low-cost motivation & follow-up

* Give simple recognition (Canva certificate) to people/departments with high reporting rates.
* Publish anonymized “lessons learned” monthly bulletin.
* Run short refresher modules based on drill findings (e.g., if many failed vishing, push a 5-min vishing module next week).

---

## 11 — Sample quick checklist for running any drill

1. Get written approval from client leadership.
2. Define scope, duration, and target group.
3. Prepare safe materials (no malware, no credential exfiltration).
4. Notify observers & documenters.
5. Run drill.
6. Immediate debrief with participants (learning-first).
7. Produce report and remediation plan.
8. Repeat after training to measure improvement.

---

### Quick wrap-up

Practical drills create memorable lessons and measurable change. Keep them safe, consensual, and always paired with immediate coaching. Small, frequent tests + friendly debriefs = real behaviour change without spending money.

---

# 📘 Chapter 13 – Showing ROI to Clients

*(Before vs After, charts, metrics)*

Training alone is not enough. Clients want proof that their **risk is going down** and the money they spend is justified.
That’s where **ROI reporting** comes in.

---

## 1. **Why ROI is Important**

* Management doesn’t care about “modules completed” → they care about **reduced risk & saved money**.
* ROI convinces decision-makers to **continue and expand the program**.
* Helps you look like a **strategic partner, not just a vendor**.

---

## 2. **What ROI Looks Like in Cybersecurity Awareness**

ROI in awareness training = **Risk Reduced + Money Saved**.

Examples:

* Phishing click rate dropped from **30% → 8%** → less chance of ransomware.
* Training completion improved from **60% → 95%** → compliance ready.
* Average quiz score increased from **65% → 85%** → employees are retaining knowledge.

---

## 3. **How to Calculate ROI (Simple Model)**

### a) **Cost Avoidance Model**

1. Average ransomware breach cost = $4M (IBM 2023 report).
2. If training reduces phishing clicks from 30% → 8%, you reduce likelihood of breach by ~70%.
3. Even preventing **one breach saves millions**.

👉 Example for a 500-employee company:

* Before training: 150 employees would click phishing.
* After training: 40 employees click phishing.
* Reduction: 110 risky employees → huge breach prevention potential.

### b) **Compliance Cost Model**

* GDPR fines: up to €20M.
* PCI-DSS penalties: thousands per incident.
* By training, company shows regulators they’re compliant.
* Avoided fines = ROI.

---

## 4. **Visualizing ROI (Before vs After)**

Use **charts** to make impact clear:

1. **Bar Chart: Phishing Click Rates**

   * Before: 30%
   * After: 8%

2. **Line Graph: Quiz Scores Over Time**

   * Jan: 65%
   * Mar: 75%
   * Jun: 85%

3. **Pie Chart: Completion Rates**

   * Before: 60%
   * After: 95%

4. **Savings Estimate Chart**

   * *“Training cost = $10,000 / Potential breach avoided = $1,000,000 → ROI = 100x.”*

---

## 5. **Practical Example – ROI Report Section**

📑 *Client: ABC Manufacturing Ltd.*

* Training Completion: **95% (↑ from 62%)**
* Quiz Score Avg: **84% (↑ from 66%)**
* Phish Click Rate: **7% (↓ from 28%)**
* Estimated Breach Risk Reduced: **70%**
* Potential Savings: **~$900,000**

👉 **Conclusion for Client:**
“For every $1 spent on awareness, you saved ~$40 in potential breach costs.”

---

## 6. **How to Present ROI to Client**

* Always show **Before vs After** side by side.
* Keep **numbers simple** → % improvement and $ saved.
* Use **charts, not paragraphs**.
* Present in **Quarterly Review Meetings** → makes you look like a security partner.

---

## 7. **Why Clients Love ROI Reports**

* Gives them **evidence** to show their board/CEO.
* Justifies budget → security is often seen as “cost,” ROI makes it an “investment.”
* Builds long-term relationship with you → they see **real measurable value**.

---

✅ **Summary (Chapter 13 in One Line):**
By comparing **Before vs After** metrics (click rates, scores, completion) and converting them into **money saved & risk reduced**, you show clients a clear ROI — making them continue and expand your awareness program.

---
